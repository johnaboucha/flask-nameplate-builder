# Nameplate Builder
 
Nameplate Builder is an Python/Flask app that allows users to create and print nameplates for their office nameplate holders. Simply fill out the create nameplate form, print it onto standard 8.5x11-inch paper in landscape mode and cut the edges off.

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete nameplates
- CSS print style formats the nameplate to fit
- Fast, simple, and fun

## Limitations:

The app is designed for a specific nameplate style and format to fit the organization's color 
and design standards. Additional styles could be added with additional CSS and template files.
